# [Course Information: Probability and Statistical Data Analysis](image.md)

## Course Description
This course is designed to introduce some statistical techniques as tools to analyse the data. In the beginning the students will be exposed with various forms of data. The data represented by the different types of variables are derived from different sources; daily and industrial activities. The analysis begins with the data representation visually. The course will also explore some methods of parameter estimation from different distributions. Further data analysis is conducted by introducing the hypothesis testing. Some models are employed to fit groups of data. At the end of course the students should be able to apply some statistical models in analysing data using available software.
