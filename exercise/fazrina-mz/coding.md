## Displaying Your Name using HTML

You can use HTML within Markdown to display your name:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Name</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, <span style="color: blue;">Your Name</span>!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

## Example: Using an if-else Statement in Python

In Python, you can use the `if-else` statement to control the flow of your program based on conditions.

Here's a simple example:

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

```
