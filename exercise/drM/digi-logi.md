## Course Description
The Digital Logic course introduces fundamental concepts and principles of digital systems and logic design. Students will gain knowledge and skills necessary for understanding and designing digital circuits used in various computer systems and electronic devices. The course will cover topics such as Boolean algebra, logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, and their applications.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental principles of digital logic.
- Apply Boolean algebra to analyze and simplify logical expressions.
- Design and implement combinational and sequential circuits.
- Analyze and troubleshoot digital circuits.
- Gain hands-on experience with hardware description languages (HDLs) for circuit design.
