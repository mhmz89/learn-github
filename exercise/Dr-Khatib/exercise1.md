# Welcome to StackEdit!

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. ~~If you want to play with Markdown~~, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.


And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- *Link text* --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```
