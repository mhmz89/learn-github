Sure, here is the code in Python for regression analysis using markdown format:

```markdown
# Import the necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Generate some data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = 2 * x + 5 + np.random.randn(100)

# Fit a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x.reshape(-1, 1), y)

# Plot the data and the fitted line
plt.plot(x, y, 'o')
plt.plot(x, model.predict(x.reshape(-1, 1)))
plt.show()

# Print the slope and intercept of the fitted line
print("Slope:", model.coef_[0])
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
```

This code first imports the necessary libraries, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and sklearn.linear_model. Then, it generates some data and fits a linear regression model to it. The model is then plotted along with the data, and the slope and intercept of the fitted line are printed.

The following is a brief explanation of each step in the code:

* The `import` statements import the necessary libraries.
* The `np.linspace()` function generates 100 evenly spaced points between 0 and 10.
* The `np.random.randn()` function generates 100 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
* The `model.fit()` method fits the linear regression model to the data.
* The `plt.plot()` method plots the data and the fitted line.
* The `print()` statements print the slope and intercept of the fitted line.

I hope this helps!
