## Course Overview
This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of programming techniques using the C++ programming language. Students will learn the fundamentals of C++ and gain hands-on experience in applying various programming techniques to solve real-world problems. The course will cover topics such as object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, memory management, and more.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the basic syntax and features of the C++ programming language.
- Apply object-oriented programming concepts in C++.
- Implement and manipulate various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- Develop efficient algorithms to solve common programming problems.
- Manage memory dynamically using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
- Utilize C++ standard library functions and templates.
- Write modular and reusable code using functions and classes.
- Debug and troubleshoot C++ programs using appropriate tools and techniques.
