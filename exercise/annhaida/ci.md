# Geometric Modelling Course

## Course Description

The Geometric Modelling course explores the principles, techniques, and applications of geometric representation and manipulation in computer graphics and design. This course covers a wide range of topics, including curves, surfaces, solid modeling, transformations, and visualization techniques. Students will learn how to create, manipulate, and analyze complex geometric shapes, which are fundamental to various fields such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer graphics, virtual reality, and more.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. Understand the mathematical foundations of curves, surfaces, and solid modeling.
2. Apply various techniques for parametric representation of curves and surfaces.
3. Implement transformations and deformations of geometric objects.
4. Create and manipulate 3D models using geometric primitives and operations.
5. Analyze and evaluate the suitability of different geometric representations for specific applications.
6. Implement and visualize geometric algorithms using programming languages and software tools.
